# Collab Virtual Incubator
Collab pairs up NGOs and advocacy-based organizations with talented, emerging, and growing teams of students to put together tech-enabled projects and initiatives aligned with cause.
Operating as a virtual incubator, Collab has a ten-week program featuring mentorship sessions, webinars/talks, and scattered in-person events to develop product, people, and passion. At the end of Collab, we're giving teams the opportunity to exhibit and share their work in a *Demo Day*.
